# <Project-Portfolio>

## Description

I created this webpage to serve as a portfolio to display all my future work. This will give me a convinient and stylish 
way to present my work, and hopefully it will look good to employers. I now have a much deeper understanding of HTML and CSS from working 
on this project, particularly when it comes to working with flex boxes and pseudo-selectors within CSS.

## Installation

All you need to do is pull the code down from the repository, open it in your IDE of choice, and run it in a browser.

## Usage

The page is just meant to display my work. The only functionality within the webpage are the links to my projects/contact-info/socials.

## Credits

I learned pretty much everything from the head instructor and the TA's from the bootcamp I am 
currently enrolled in. I used two images from the internet in this project, the links are listed below.
